Chocolate Cookies,Milk,Papaya
Apples,Milk,Diapers
Chocolate cookies,Apples,Milk,Diapers
Apples,Diapers

From this we get 5 sets of 1 element:
chocolate cookies, milk, papaya, apples, diapers.

papaya is filtered out as its support is less than 50%

Support:
chocolate cookies   = 2/4
diapers             = 3/4
apples              = 3/4
milk                = 3/4

Using the remaining elements, four, we create subsets of 2 elements.
The order is not important, they are combinations:

4 choose 2 = 6.

1. chocolate cookies, milk
2. chocolate cookies, apples
3. milk, apples
4. diapers, apples
5. milk, diapers
6. diapers, chocolate cookies

then we compute the support for each of the 2-element subsets.

1. => 2/4
2. => 1/4
3. => 1/4
4. => 2/4
5. => 2/4
6. => 1/4

We filter out those with a support less than 0.5.
We get:
    chocolate cookies,milk
    diapers, apples
    milk, diapers
    apples, milk

Than we compute all the subsets with k = 3
    4 choose 3  = 4.
1. chocolate cookies, milk, apples
2. chocolate cookies, milk, diapers
3. milk, diapers, apples
4. diapers, apples, chocolate cookies

Compute the support for each: we can see that all of them have a support of 0.25,
thus they can be all discarded.


Let's make an association rule:
    chocolate cookies => milk.
    Compute the confidence of this:
        C = S(cookies and milk)/ S(cookies) = 0.5 / 0.5  = 1
    We keep it.

    milk => cookies
        C = S(cookies and milk)/ S(milk) = 0.5 / 0.75 = 0.67.

    and so on...
